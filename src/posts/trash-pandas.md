## Trash Pandas 


### What racoons can teach us about data collection

Data streams can be broken down into two types: manual and automated. And unless you’re Amazon, your operation will still rely on manual data inputs—from field reports and repair logs to inventory counts and rework trackers. You’ll need to find a reliable data collection process that works for you and your technicians.

_In operations the bottleneck is often in the raw data collection_

When we rely on humans for data entry,  we tend to see bottlenecks form. Data entry means context switching—it takes time and distracts from the task at hand. While we have been conditioned to always want more data, this is not always the best choice. You will not be thanked for the additional burden, and you might even harm the operation. Field teams can lose efficiency, and the data they collect can lose validity. Data-hungry analysts must recognize themselves for what they are—_intruders_. And as intruders, they must adopt techniques that allow themselves to survive and flourish in a hostile environment.

If this sounds discouraging, then look no further than our friend the racoon.


### RACCOONS BEHAVIOR

Racoons are frustratingly clever creatures. They have reasoning skills comparable to some monkeys. Their sensitive, dexterous hands can unclip latches, open lids and unscrew caps. They are rarely intimidated by humans and have made themselves part of many urban neighborhoods. Their nightly misadventures make for Instragram legends. But most importantly—these swamp mammals have learned to thrive among humans, with [up to 150 living in every square kilometer of city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon).

Let’s examine a hypothetical racoon named Charlie who lives somewhere on my block. Charlie’s objective is to find enough food to survive. 

If Charlie was to waltz into my neighbor's apartment, perch expectantly at the dining room table, and demand to be fed, he would be met with a great deal of consternation and maybe even shouting. Demanding food will be met with a boot, a slammed door or even poison.

_Is that you, Charlie?_

Charlie has a better strategy. He sits quietly outside my neighbor’s house and observes. In no time at all, he will discover when the garbage is taken out and what day of the week the garage truck arrives. After a few weeks of monitoring the garbage bin, Charlie will know more about my neighbor’s dietary habits than my neighbor’s doctor.

Racoons cannot dictate human behavior. They cannot make any demands and expect results. Instead, they flourish by exploiting the patterns of their benefactors. They are students of our behavior. The successful racoon goes mostly unnoticed yet manages to eat their fill. With the average American [throwing out](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/18/americans-waste-food-fruit-vegetables-study) 300 pounds each year, there is plenty to go around.


### COLLECTING DATA LIKE A RACOON

Are you expecting the data to come to you? Don’t be silly. Go to the source. Scope out what’s going on. Otherwise, you will end up analyzing an unworkable mess rather than delicious leftovers.

Would you like to demand 3x the data points? Demanding too much will get a hostile response. Go where the food is accumulating naturally—otherwise, you may find a lock on the next bin you try to open up. 

You think data is a one-way street? Try giving something back to those putting in all the effort to collect it. Charlie is likely to get a warmer response if he keeps other pests aways. That’s a symbiotic relationship!  

Are you expecting clean data straight from the source? Too bad! Learn to pick through the garbage. Even if it doesn't have the original wrapper, it’s still delicious and nutritious. I promise you: there's a lot of perfectly good data to be had, and lets be real—normalizing data is your job. 

So data friends, before you start to write your 792nd SQL query, take a moment to reflect how you are collecting the data. Pretend you’re the trash panda. Be pragmatic. Be clever. Don’t ask for too much, and you will find that what you receive will be bountiful without any trace of poison.

### KEY PRINCIPLES


*   Go to the source - don’t expect the data to come to you
*   Make do with less - or risk harming the quality of your data
*   Give back - If you’re going to ask for data, provide some benefits
*   Get clever - you will find the data you need
