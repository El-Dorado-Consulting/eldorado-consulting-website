## {title}

On more than one occasion, I have seen well-intentioned people try to improve a repair operation only to, in a matter of days, make themselves persona non grata. They are chided for poor change management, and they ask themselves, “Where did I go wrong?” 

Changes to repair operations go most smoothly when managers build goodwill with mechanics and local staff. It doesn’t take a lot of extra time—but it pays dividends over the course of a project. Building goodwill with individuals minimizes drama. As a result, it keeps development agile, and it also grows strong relationships that are essential to a project’s long-term success. 

Here’s a helpful tool to visualize your goal: Imagine everyone has “a reservoir of goodwill”—just like a battery. Everyone has a little charge to give. Some have more to give than others; and the amount can vary day-to-day, situation-to-situation. Some have triggers that will instantly deplete all goodwill—or short-circuit, if you will—like being asked to do more data entry. Your job is to keep people’s level of goodwill from reaching empty. If that good energy runs out, expect the pace of work to slow.

So how do you build goodwill? In short—by trying to empathize with each individual and understanding their burdens. When you enter a warehouse for the first time, for instance, don’t let yourself be a stranger! I make sure to introduce myself to as many people as possible and learn a bit about each person. (It also helps me remember their name.) Show that you’re a real and respectful human being! This is a great way to start off strong and recharge a team’s spirits. You’d be surprised how many people get labeled as “another aloof manager” right off the bat. Leaving mechanics in the cold is like leaving batteries in the cold—it’s a great way to go from 30% to dead in an instant. 

Building some 1:1 rapport will give you an initial boost of confidence and momentum—and it will likely also yield you some helpful insights to guide your early work. You may find that the parts restocking process is a bottleneck for many, or that there is an undercurrent of distrust between management and mechanics. Being inquisitive early on will help you know you’re working on the right things and tackle the bottlenecks aggressively. If you are technically minded, don’t be afraid to jump in on some processes for hands-on learning and collaboration! Perhaps you are a wheel-truing expert and can lend a hand to the refurb process, gathering ideas as you go. Even if you aren’t—some thoughtful collaboration around 5S tasks (eg sorting and cleaning) can go a long way to build respect, uncover potential issues and demonstrate humility. Hustle like this is infectious and can build goodwill quickly. 

After building some initial goodwill, it’s important to stay agile during the project and react to evolving needs. Interventions won’t always go to plan. Perhaps you used a new type of tool for a tricky task, and it’s more cumbersome than the old method. That’s OK. But be ready to acknowledge, apologize and deliver a better solution in short order. Asking a mechanic to do something poorly and pretending it’s better will make them short-circuit. And be ready to change your approach if the reception is going poorly. When in doubt, treat your mechanics’ feedback as your North Star for decision-making. This act will stop the energy drain among the team and rebuild a bit of goodwill in the process.

But how important is goodwill, really? Some managers will feel it is unnecessary. They are working to make mechanics’ lives easier, and some might even feel under-appreciated by mechanics as-is. Why do _I _need to curry favor with _them_? Others might feel at a loss when the goodwill doesn’t come after offerings of praise and favorite foods for the crew. _What am I doing wrong?_ For these managers, success is all about the data. And this is true—at least to the extent of their personal involvement. 

For a project to be successful in the long-run, however, meaningful levels of goodwill are essential. Goodwill is the solar panel that keeps feeding the project with energy long after you’re gone. If people do not think you are working in their best interest, and your time together hasn’t changed any hearts, then your project will end up like a ship without power—at the mercy of the tides, wherever they drift. Your transformation will be temporary. 

Even the greatest project manager of the modern age couldn’t succeed without goodwill. Robert Moses—a man who at one point held 12 official titles simultaneously while in government—single-handedly shaped the built-environment of New York City over 50 years, only to be dethroned by popular uprisings and see a generation of movements work to undo his legacy. His biography _The Power Broker_ ends with two questions that managers who don’t believe in building goodwill ask themselves often. 


    _Couldn't people see what I had done?_


    _Why weren't they grateful?_

Don’t let your project slip away from you like this. These are the questions asked by people whose goodwill ran out long ago and have drifted from reality, to an island unto their own. Focus on genuine connections with the people you’re working with instead. Take the time early on to fill up your “goodwill” batteries for the marathon ahead. Transformation requires inspiration. But inspired people will fight to sustain what they believe in—and you’ll walk away a little more at ease.
